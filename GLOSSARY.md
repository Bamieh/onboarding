# Common terms in open source

## CI
Continuous integration, a way to automatically run tests over proposed changes

## CLI
Command-line interface, a way of interacting with a tool via the terminal or command line

## git
A tool for version control

## LGTM
Looks good to me (often used as a concise review on a pull request)

## linting
The process (often through an automatic 'linter') of ensuring that a codebase adheres to syntax and style guidelines

## master
Master branch: typically the main or production branch of a repo. On an open source project, you would typically work on a different branch checked out from master, then submit proposed changes in the form of a pull request to the master branch

## onboarding
The process of getting up to speed on a project, typically to the point of being able to make valuable contributions. In code projects, this can involve becoming familiar with file structure, tools, social processes and expectations, and available documentation.

## OSHW
Open source hardware

## OSS
Open source software

## PR
Pull request, a way to submit changes for acceptance into a project

## pull request
A way to submit changes for acceptance into a project. It superimposes the changes made in one branch (usually your working branch) onto another branch (often the master branch) and proposes that the merged result be accepted as the new canonical version of that branch

## r?
Shorthand to request a review

## r+
Shorthand to mark approval of a proposed change

## rebase
When you make a new branch, it is usually based on an existing branch, to which you then make changes. Rebasing is a way to apply your changes starting from a different branch than your branch was originally created from. You will most commonly see this as "please rebase your branch on master", which is a request to merge the current master branch of a repo into your changes, typically after you originally created your branch from a version of master that is now obsolete (`master` has been updated while you were working). See `git rebase` documentation for a more pragmatic description

## repo
Short for "repository", a place where code is stored (typically in the context of git)

## review
Technical testing and read-through with comments, typically of a proposed change in a pull request

## RTFM
read the f'ing manual

## SGTM
Sounds good to me

## version control
A way of saving a project such that new changes don't overwrite old versions– a sort of parallel universe theory applied to files, where each change branches from the previous change

## YAGNI
"You aren't gonna need it", the principle that you shouldn't add a functionality unless it is already needed
