# Tips for people new to contributing to open source projects

*not necessarily github-specific*

## Contributing to public repos
* Make a commit message with every commit describing what the commit does
* If you have to commit multiple times to fix/re-fix/whoops forgot something fix again, it's good etiquette on most repos to edit your commit history (`git squash` or `git commit --amend` are useful commands for this)
* If you have a commit that specifically fixes a Github issue, making your commit message "fixes `issue link`" is both descriptive and functional (Github automatically closes that issue if your commit is merged)
* Project maintainers might be forgetful! If you have a pull request or issue that has been languishing with no response for several days, it's okay to at-mention someone appropriate (see the repo's contribution guidelines, if there are any) or otherwise make a follow-up comment
* If someone has reviewed your pull request and suggested edits, it's up to you to ask for a second review once you've made the edits

## Making personal projects
* Make a readme! Make it right away, and write down what you know about your project, because it's amazing how much you will forget or change as time goes on
* In your readme, write down any commands you will need to remember in order to test, deploy, etc. Write down and describe any commands you need in order to work with your project, especially if you are new to coding/this language/this framework/this development style/etc.
* When you think of things you want to add or improve but don't have time to do right away, make issues for those things
