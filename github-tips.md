# Tips for people new to contributing to open source projects

*not necessarily github-specific*

* Make a commit message with every commit describing what the commit does
* If you have to commit multiple times to fix/re-fix/whoops forgot something fix again, it's good etiquette on most repos to edit your commit history (`git squash` or `git commit --amend` are useful commands for this)
* If you have a commit that specifically fixes a Github issue, making your commit message "fixes `issue link`" is both descriptive and functional (Github automatically closes that issue if your commit is merged)
* Project maintainers might be forgetful! If you have a pull request or issue that has been languishing with no response for several days, it's okay to at-mention someone appropriate (see the repo's contribution guidelines, if there are any) or otherwise make a follow-up comment
* If someone has reviewed your pull request and suggested edits, it's up to you to ask for a second review once you've made the edits
